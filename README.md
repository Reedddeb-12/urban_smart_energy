## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using LocalStorage:

- Projects and causes

**Note**: Data persists in your browser but is not synced across devices. Clear browser data will reset the application.

## Calculations

### Baseline Calculation
- Uses average of first 3 bills as baseline
- Compares subsequent bills against baseline

### Savings Calculation
```
Energy Saved (kWh) = Baseline - Current Consumption
Money Saved (₹) = Energy Saved × Electricity Rate (₹/kWh)
CO₂ Saved (kg) = Energy Saved × 0.92

Example: If you save 100 kWh at ₹8.50/kWh
- Money Saved = 100 × 8.50 = ₹850
- CO₂ Saved = 100 × 0.92 = 92 kg
```

### Streak Logic
- Daily streak increments when actions logged on consecutive days
- Resets to 1 if a day is missed
- Weekly streak increments every 7 days

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Responsive Design

The platform is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop (1024px+)
- Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Mobile (< 768px)
