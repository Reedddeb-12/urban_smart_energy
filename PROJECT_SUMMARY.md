## 📈 Stock Investment Feature

### Available Stocks (8 Companies):

1. **Adani Green Energy Ltd** (ADANIGREEN.NS) - ₹1,245.50
2. **Tata Power Company Ltd** (TATAPOWER.NS) - ₹385.75

## 🌍 Environmental Impact

### CO₂ Calculation:
```
Energy Saved (kWh) × 0.92 kg CO₂/kWh = CO₂ Saved

Example:
60 kWh saved × 0.92 = 55.2 kg CO₂ prevented
```

### Visual Comparisons:
- Trees planted equivalent
- Car kilometers avoided
- Coal not burned
- Phone charges
- And more...

## 💰 Savings Calculation

### How It Works:

1. **Baseline** (First 3 bills): Average consumption
2. **Comparison**: Current bill vs baseline
3. **Savings**: (Baseline - Current) × Rate
4. **Investment**: Use savings to buy stocks

### Example:
```
Baseline: 310 kWh/month
Current: 250 kWh/month
Saved: 60 kWh
Money: 60 × ₹8.50 = ₹510
Action: Invest ₹510 in renewable stocks!
```
